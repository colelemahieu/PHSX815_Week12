### Homework 13
"central.py" demonstrates the Central Limit Theorem using a Rayleigh distribution. The Rayleigh distribution is sampled and averaged over many experiments. These averages make a Gaussian-shaped distribution. The output shows 2 figures; the second figure using 10 times as many measurements per experiment as the first firgure for
comparison.

The user can specify number of experiments and number of measurements for the first figure use "-Nexp" and "-Nmeas".

eg: "python central.py -Nexp 150 -Nmeas 98"
